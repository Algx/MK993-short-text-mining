How many bites does it take to get to the lamb filled center of a gyros-pop?

I'd say one, cause if you can't find gyros on the first bite, there's probably something wrong with your order ;-) ... are you sure you didn't order the chicken?

And you thought I was going to say something deep and meaningful, you obviously don't know me that well.

Cypress Grill is my favorite place for a gyros in Central Phoenix. There's a handful of them around (gyros spots that is), but if you're looking for a gyros and within a few miles of this place, I'd say skip all the rest. I've tried at least five or so spots that serve em nearby. You'll spend a couple bucks more here than at the other places, with a gyro running you about $8, but I'm happy to conclude that Cypress is my favorite gyro in town.

The hummus here is good, so is the spanikopita and dolmades. For those of you who are carb counting, you can get your gyros in a salad too. I've done that a few times myself. All in all a solid choice for medditeranean dining - one of the better spots in the area. 

Happy Yelping Phoenix!
