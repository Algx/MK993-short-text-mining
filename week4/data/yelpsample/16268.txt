Old school yo!

We're talking salad bar with beets, sunflower seeds and cottage cheese yo!

We're talking prime rib of Flintstonian proportions! 

I met a group of good friends here recently. We were seated in a back (non window) room and my claustrophobia almost got the best of me. It was a pretty tiny room. Soon I decided it wasn't tiny. It was cozy. And soon the Coronas were a- comin' and the conversation was flowing.

Our server, a delightful woman, was efficient and friendly. And a shout out to her just for handling a group of a dozen or so yelpers! Can you imagine waiting on us lol!?!?

My prime rib and baked potato were pure perfection. The salad bar was fresh and fully loaded. 

Much like myself towards the end of the evening.

The decor is all muraled-out if memory serves me. So there's a lot going on! 

So Feeney's you got a new fan! Great place to take my folks, out of towners or anyone I think is worthy of the Feeney charm!!!

Yo!
