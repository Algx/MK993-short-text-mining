       "'rated on a 4-star scale screening venue : odoen ( liverpool city centre ) released in the uk by uip on april 7 , 2000 ; certificate 15 ; 126 minutes ; country of origin usa ; aspect ratio 1 . 85 : 1 directed by stephen soderbergh ; produced by danny devito , michael shamberg , stacey sher . written by susannah grant . photographed by ed lachmann ; edited by anne v . coates . it\\'s astounding , how many of us turn into lawyers when we get wrapped up in cases . i remember the louise woodward affair , for example , when i knew all the evidence from the courtroom pictures on tv , and was able to reel off detailed arguments crushing people who had just looked at her and assumed she was guilty . passion about justice is what makes people consider law careers ; it chills me when i see sell-outs trying to condemn obviously innocent people , or using dishonest tactics to help the guilty . stephen soderbergh\\'s \" erin brockovich \" is a brilliant story of anger turning into courtroom skills ; a david versus goliath-style expos in the great tradition of \" silkwood \" , \" a civil action \" and \" the insider \" . at its centre is a woman with no judiciary training or expertise , whose mind was not complicated with red tape or histories of statutes , and whose discoveries and simple logical interpretations helped small-time lawyers win one of the biggest lawsuits in american history . her name , of course , is erin brockovich ( julia roberts ) , and when we meet her in the opening scenes of this film , she\\'s just a struggling single mother who has failed to win a personal injury settlement . soon after , she hustles her way into a filing job at the firm of her solicitor . the boss , ed masry ( albert finney ) , objects , but erin makes her services hard to refuse : \" i need a job . don\\'t make me beg . if it doesn\\'t work out , fire me . \" when handling the real estate documents of a town in california , erin notices something odd -- they all include medical records . researching this further , she stumbles on the information that the area\\'s water supplier , pacific gas & electric , has been using a dangerous chemical known as \\'hexavalent chromium 3\\' in their pipes . \\'chromium 3\\' can penetrate the body to cause pretty much any illness , including all forms of cancer . what\\'s especially horrific is that pg&e knew about the hazards of their water and misinformed its customers that chromium was good for them . the people took the company\\'s word , even when they all started to get sick , until erin brockovich revealed her findings , and used her common touch to encourage the folks to stand up and take legal action . brockovich is not always a likeable character . at the start of the movie , when no job interviewers will look past her lack of a resum or qualifications , her feeling of victimisation is preposterous . she seems to think anyone who isn\\'t stuck in the poverty trap must be some sort of snob . and she displays gross arrogance when defending her wardrobe , which is made up of mini-skirts , tight boob tubes and high-heeled boots . \" as long as i have one ass instead of two , \" she tells masry when he points out that his office has a dress code , \" i\\'ll wear what i god damn well please . \" but none of these flaws take away from her achievement , which is that she worked hard , taught herself some tough skills , became a great friend and advocate for victims of an abominable crime , and managed to raise a family at the same time . this is one of roberts\\'s most impressive performances , her best since \" pretty woman \" ( 1990 ) , because she really does look affected by the pressures her character has to cope with . she allows herself to be vulnerable , with a voice that can quiver and stumble . she doesn\\'t always have the answers , and could break down at any minute . there are one or two irritating episodes of grandstanding , where she rattles off snappy , heroic speeches that probably took the screenwriter hours to write ; but that\\'s kind of obligatory , and i\\'m just glad that such moments don\\'t dominate the film . \" erin brockovich \" is not necessarily better than the films i previously mentioned , but has advantages over each of them in one way or another . it\\'s more fast-paced and accessible than \" silkwood \" , angrier about its subject matter than \" a civil action \" and less sidetracked than \" the insider \" . i\\'m starting to love director soderbergh\\'s new visual style , too , which he also used in \" out of sight \" , and mixes the colour palette and star power of big studio movies with the documentary camera and quiet pacing of realistic independents . sounds distracting . but it\\'s oddly compelling . copyright ( c ) 2000 ian waldron-mantgani please visit , and encourage others to visit , the uk critic\\'s website , which is located at http : //members . aol . com/ukcritic \\n'"
