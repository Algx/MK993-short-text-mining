Like the 80s group ABC sang "It's so hip, so hip it hurts"... But hurt in a good way (you know, like nice, naughty spanking) and not bad hurts like the sound of Lindsay Lohan's voice. Are we clear? I was an Urban Studies/Architecture major in college and I love this whole 50s style meets mid modern meets Scottsdale. From the lobby to the grounds to the pool to our charming, color splashed, glass brick adorned room, this was a major score in the Staycation category. I was initially intimidated by the pool crowd as I noticed NOBODY was actually IN the pool. Just posing around the pool. Were they looking at my pasty white Scandinavian skin? My extremely, freakishly small nipples? Or the Hello Kitty towel I brought from home? Hmmm..fBack to the room....the glass brick divided the room from the shower...and what a fabulous shower. Nice, big, pulsating head. Honestly, I'm not trying to go all pg13 on ya! Bed and bedding were cozy and spotless. A great place to crash after Rickie's headlining collection at Phoenix Fashion Week. The room was at one point spacious enough to accommodate Mr. Gonzales, the stylist, the assistant and anywhere from three to eight models. I was comfy on our fabulous bed with a glass of wine watching it all unravel in front me. Who needs TV? It was very entertaining. And when I needed to escape we had our own private patio. Wait? Wasn't that a B52s song? So Valley Ho...you are hip. But you're also great deal. A great venue. And yes, maybe even, OK, I"m getting a little vaklempt, a great friend....
