Need an Alvin and the Chipmunk get up? Easleys.
Need masks for a glamorous "Eyes Wide Shut" kinda party. Easley's.
Need a tail to complete a grown man dressed up as a kitty. Easley's.
Need a pink cowboy hat bedazzled with silver rhinestones. Easley's. 

Need a vintage Hello Kitty brouche (spell check not working!) to attach to pink cowboy hat bedazzled with silver rhinestones so it can be worn to an upcoming yelp Elite Event at Rustler's Rooste. Not Easley's. 

Thankfully I have a designer boyfriend with lots of goodies in his studio. So that was an easy fix. 

What a fun place this would be to work. And it must be. Staff is always friendly and helpful. Easley's is a Phoenix institution. 

Like Jan Brewer's speech coach. 
Like Dan Harkins parking spot.
Like, well, like an early fall kick in the nuts heat wave from Mother Nature. 

Easely's!
