I'm going to keep this one general and not too detailed; we all have to keep something private from the rest of the Yelp world, right?!

I will say that last night after the Ignite event and post Ignite event, Jared and I stopped by this Fascinations store... we were pleasantly greeted by the staff but since we were not looking for anything specific, they let us wander and be 'fascinated' by all of the sex toys, party favors, under garments, games, videos, and more... (they do have a decent selection!)

Not that I go into these types of stores often, but when I do, I like having the comfort of being with someone I am close to and/or not being harassed by the salespeople. (Yes, I'm shy, what can i say?!)  Luckily, I had both of these things during my visit last night.  We did make a few purchases, and I even tried to sneak in a package of 'nippies' since J was paying.  He caught it though, and decided to take those off of the bill (they were $14).  I thought they would be perfect for getting a nice tan line - I may have to return to make that purchase on my own!

If you're in the market for anything that you think Fascinations may carry (and believe me, if you think they do, they probably do), go pay them a visit!  Enjoy and remember to practice safe sex!
